# Graduation Website

Simple graduation website made with [**TailwindCSS**](https://tailwindcss.com) and [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/?uwu). The UIs are copied from [Pengumuman SNBP](https://pengumuman-snbp.snpmb.id/)

## Technologies / Stacks
- Next.js https://nextjs.org
- TailwindCSS https://tailwindcss.com
- VervalPD https://npmjs.com/package/vervalpd-node

## Planned Feature(s) / TODO(s)
- Integrate with [E-Ijazah] (https://ijazah.data.kemdikbud.go.id/dasbor/beranda), so that students who have graduated can track their ijazah or final report without having to ask the school. You can contribute at https://github.com/hansputera/eijazah-wrapper if you want to help me implement this feature.
- Updating the graduating student policy, graduating students **MUST** be listed on the DNT (Permanent Nomination Data) on the E-Ijazah. And, graduating students **MUST** be registered as grade 12 students.
